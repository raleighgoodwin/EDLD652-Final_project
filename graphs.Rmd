data$VacConBlf == datasav$VacConBlf # i don't know why this is coming up with F's when visual inspection looks like they're identical... i'm going to assume they're the same...?

# This df doesn't seem to have any variable name abnormalities, which is nice, but the main reason I like to use a .sav file over a .csv file is because it retains "attributes" about the variables, which can be really useful for things like knowing the exact question and sometimes for the names of factor levels, etc. But in this case it doesn't really matter which you use! Just thought I'd bring it up, though.

# my overall impression i get based on these plots is that these distributions roughly look pretty similar even though they of course aren't exactly identical. it might be fun to add vertical lines for the mean, median, and modes for males and females. what these plots make me really want to know is whether these potential differences in means are significant. that might be useful information to include in the text that accompanies the figures in your final product.
